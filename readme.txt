[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod allows permitted membergroups to edit and unsend personal messages, as long as nobody has read them.

This mod has been tested with the [url=http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=1974]PM Attachments[/url] mod, and does support adding and removing PM attachments while editing the PM.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Admin Settings[/u][/size][/b][/color]
In [b]Admin[/b] => [b]Members[/b] => [b]Permissions[/b], there are two new permissions:
o [b]Can Edit Unread PMs[/b]
o [b]Can Unsend Unread PMs[/b]

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Legacy Disclaimer[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod was part of the now-discontinued [url=http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?topic=521508.0]Enhanced PM System[/url].  It is been seperated from it and built into a newer, hopefully better mod...

This updated mod makes additional checks to make sure nobody has read the PM before you are allowed to edit or unsend it.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Compatibility Notes[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.13, but should work on SMF 2.0 and up.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.
