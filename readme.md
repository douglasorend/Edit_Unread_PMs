# EDIT UNREAD PMs v1.5

[**By Dougiefresh**](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=253913) -> [Link to Mod](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=4140)

--------

## Introduction
This mod allows permitted membergroups to edit and unsend personal messages, as long as nobody has read them.

This mod has been tested with the [PM Attachments](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=1974) mod, and does support adding and removing PM attachments while editing the PM.

## Admin Settings
In **Admin** => **Members** => **Permissions**, there are two new permissions:

- **Can Edit Unread PMs**
- **Can Unsend Unread PMs**

## Legacy Disclaimer
This mod was part of the now-discontinued [Enhanced PM System](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?topic=521508.0).  It is been seperated from it and built into a newer, hopefully better mod...

This updated mod makes additional checks to make sure nobody has read the PM before you are allowed to edit or unsend it.

## Compatibility Notes
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.13, but should work on SMF 2.1 Beta 3, as well as SMF 2.0 and up.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.

This mod should be installed **AFTER** the [PM Attachments](https://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=1974) mod!
